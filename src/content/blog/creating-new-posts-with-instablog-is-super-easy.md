## Why this post?

To tell you a bit more about title, metaTitle, description, excerpt, etc.  
It's probably obvious, but stick around.  

### title

The **title** will be used as heading 1 in the post, but also as a title in the overview cards.  
The **metaTitle** is used in the `<head>` section of the page as `<title>`.

### description

**description** is what will be added to the `<head>` as `<meta name='description'...>`, but also as body text in the overview cards when the **excerpt** is missing.

### excerpt

This overwrites the description in the overview cards in case you want to use a different text there.

### datePublished

Obviously, the date you will publish it (and yes, you have to set this by hand in an valid format...).  
**IF** this is empty, the post will not be rendered, simulating a sort of draft version

### image

Well... You get it I guess...  
leave the alt if you don't want to add text to it.  

### keywords

This can't be much of a surprise can it?  
Keywords for the meta tag.
